<h2>Machine Learning Projects</h2>

<h3><a href ="https://github.com/prahity/Portfolio/blob/main/DigitalSemaphoreResearchPaper.pdf"> Audio Reconstruction from Visual Vibrations  </a></h3>
<p> Implemented template matching algorithm to convert visual vibrations to spectrograms and classified images to spoken word with a custom CNN model, expanding the range of audio recognition (Tensorflow, OpenCV, Python)</p>

<h3> Cancer Cell Image Synthesis</h3>
<p>Leveraged Pix2Pix, U-net, and VGG GAN frameworks on HAL cluster to generate cancer cell images from low-quality microscopy images, allowing for faster and more accurate disease diagnosis (Pytorch, Python)</p>

<h3><a href ="https://devpost.com/software/tensor-crop-tracker-tct-ai"> Plant Disease Detection App</a></h3>
<p>Designed a plant disease detection app to identify plant health conditions using CNN, track plant location, and provide treatment plans using an integrated chatbot API, allowing for efficient disease detection (Python, Tensorflow, Swift)</p>

<h3>Enhancing Transformers</h3>
<p>Enhanced transformer-based models for the Oxford 102 Flowers dataset and the Pixmo dataset on the Delta AI cluster, employing strategies such as visual prompt tuning (Pytorch, Python)<p>
  
<h3> <a href = "https://github.com/prahity/Portfolio/blob/main/DeepFakeDetectionResearchPaper.pdf">DeepFake Detection</a></h3>
<p>Developed preprocessing methods using Discrete Cosine Transform and kernel sharpening to enhance DeepFake detection with a custom CNN (Tensorflow, Python)</p>

<h3> <a href = "https://www.datascience4everyone.org/post/after-the-ap-data-science-champions-announced"> Student Loan Default Rate Predictor</a></h3>
<p> Created ML model to predict student loan default rates with a dataset of 4000+ colleges, winning first place for highest accuracy (R)</p>


<h2>Systems Programming </h2>

<h3>GPU Integration for STAPL Parallel Programming Library</h3>
<p>Achieved 10-100x scaling speedups with GPUs by utilizing pinned memory and zero-copy memory transfers, providing proof of concept for GPU algorithm speedup at Parasol Lab (C/C++, STAPL)


<h2>Web Programming</h2>

<h3> <a href = "https://github.com/prahity/VocabularyBuilder">Skills Builder </a> </h3>
<p> Designed a full-stack web application with 1000+ flashcards to enhance student vocabulary and math skills (React, Python, RedisDB)</p>

<h3>Room Reservation App </h3>
<p>Built a room reservation app to connect hotel chain managers and customers for efficient bookings (React, NodeJS, MongoDB) </p>


<h2>Mobile Programming</h2> 

<h3>iOS</h3> 
<b>Developed an iPhone virtual stock trading app using Yahoo Finance API data to promote financial awareness among students (Swift) </p>
